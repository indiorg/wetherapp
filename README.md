Weather App

This project is a simple **Weather App** that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city. The app fetches the weather data using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and it displays relevant weather details such as temperature, weather description, and wind speed. Additionally, the app uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) to fetch and display a background image related to the city.

### Features:
- Fetches and displays the current weather information of a city.
- Displays the city name, temperature, weather description, and wind speed.
- Dynamically sets a background image of the city fetched from Unsplash.

- **HTML** for structuring the app.
